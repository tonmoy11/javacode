* Hand.java
* Author: Tonmoy M Iskander
* Submission Date: 07/27/2015 *
* Purpose: A brief paragraph description of the
* program. What does it do? How does it do it? 
The class Hand represents the cards in a player or dealers hands during a game of 
Black Jack or potentially other card games. 
Remember â€“ when we design classes such as Card or Hand,
 we design them in a general way so that we could reuse this code later when we create a different game.
